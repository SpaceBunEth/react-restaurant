### WireFrame
![wireframe pic](wireframe.jpg)
## Pseudocode
In this assignment we will create a restaurant website, single page dynamic webpage, made in React.

Our wireframe outlines some atomic design elements that will help us break down our project into small elements.

We will also be creating a way to manage state. We will be following the [MVC](https://www.codecademy.com/article/mvc) Model, View, Controller principles to manage our state, and how state will change the UI usign React lifeCycles to help control and display the change in state and UI.

I am new to React here are some noobie questions I would like to answer for myself. These answers are needed to create to a functioning program.

- How do we manage state in React?
- How do we make a API call using React?
- How do we get bootstrap to work with React?
